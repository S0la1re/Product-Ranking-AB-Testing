    "### Understanding the Nature of the Product\n",
    "\n",
    "Rimi is an online grocery store that offers a wide range of products, including fresh produce, meat, dairy, baked goods, and more. The store uses a product ranking system or recommendation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user enters keywords such as \"meat\" or \"fruits,\" this algorithm generates a list of products that could be relevant to that customer, based on factors like their profile, purchase history, and other data.\n",

    "\n",

    "1. **Measurable**\n",
    "    - Is it a type of user behavior that can be accurately captured through your instrumentation or platform?\n",
    "2. **Attributable**\n",
    "    - \"Attributable\" means establishing a clear link between the experiment and the observed changes in metrics.\n",
    "    - Example: If you are testing a new website design (treatment) and notice an increase in conversions (metric), for the result to be considered \"attributable,\" you need to be sure that the increase is specifically due to the design change, and not, for example, due to an increase in traffic or a marketing campaign that occurred during the same period.\n",
    "3. **Sensitive**\n",
    "    - A metric is considered \"sensitive\" if it is responsive enough to detect significant effects from the applied modification.\n",
    "    - You want to identify a metric with low variability to increase the likelihood of detecting true effects.\n",
    "4. **Timely**\n",
    "    - A/B experiments need to be very quick, it's a very iterative process as a way to improve the product very quickly.\n",
    "    - Therefore, consider what short-term behavior can serve as a proxy for the long-term desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our success metric is **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**, which we aim to increase. However, it's crucial that this improvement does not come at the expense of the **Conversion Rate**, which should remain stable or improve.\n"

    "- We can easily calculate this using Python and the `statsmodels` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula Explanation\n",
    "- $n$ — This is the required sample size for each group (control and experimental).\n",
    "- $Z_{\\alpha/2}$ — This is the critical value of the normal distribution for the significance level ($\\alpha$). It is set as $\\alpha/2$ because we often use a two-tailed test. For example, for a significance level of 0.05, the value of $Z_{\\alpha/2}$ is approximately 1.96.\n",
    "- $Z_\\beta$ — This is the critical value for the test power ($\\beta$). For example, for a power of 0.8, the value of $Z_\\beta$  is approximately 0.84. The power of the test is the probability of detecting an effect if it exists, and it is commonly set at 80%.\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ — This is the variance (the square of the standard deviation) of your metric. In the case of comparing means, it represents how spread out the values of the metric are (e.g., Average Revenue Per User or ARPU).\n",
    "- $\\delta$ —  This is the minimum detectable effect (MDE). It is the difference between the means of the control and experimental groups that you want to detect. The smaller $\\delta$, the larger the sample size needed to accurately detect this difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "Since we don’t have real data, we’ll estimate what it could look like based on industry averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Estimating ARPU\n",
    "1. The average revenue per user (ARPU) in online grocery stores can vary significantly depending on how often customers place orders, their average basket size, and other factors.\n",
    "2. Typical industry data:\n",
    "    - ChatGPT suggests that ARPU for online grocery retailers often ranges from 20 to 100 euros, depending on the region and shopping frequency. The standard deviation ($\\sigma$), on average, can range from 20% to 50% of the average ARPU.\n",
    "3. Assumption:\n",
    "    - **Average ARPU** = 50 euros\n",
    "    - **Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$)** = 15 euros (which corresponds to 30% of the average).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Estimating Conversion Rate\n",
    "1. The conversion rate for online grocery stores is the percentage of users who complete a purchase out of the total number of website visitors.\n",
    "2. Typical industry data:\n",
    "    - Based on ChatGPT’s response, on average, the conversion rate for online grocery stores can range from 2% to 5%. However, grocery stores have a certain specificity — if a customer visits with the intent to buy groceries, the conversion rate might be higher compared to apparel or electronics stores.\n",
    "    - For large retailers like Rimi, the conversion rate may be closer to the upper end of this range.\n",
    "3. Assumption:\n",
    "    - **Conversion rate**: 3-5% (which corresponds to the conversion rate for a typical online grocery store)."
