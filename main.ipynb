    "### Understanding the Nature of the Product\n",
    "\n",
    "Rimi is an online grocery store that offers a wide range of products, including fresh produce, meat, dairy, baked goods, and more. The store uses a product ranking system or recommendation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user enters keywords such as \"meat\" or \"fruits,\" this algorithm generates a list of products that could be relevant to that customer, based on factors like their profile, purchase history, and other data.\n",

    "### Define the Success Metric\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Measurable**\n",
    "    - Is it a type of user behavior that can be accurately captured through your instrumentation or platform?\n",
    "2. **Attributable**\n",
    "    - \"Attributable\" means establishing a clear link between the experiment and the observed changes in metrics.\n",
    "    - Example: If you are testing a new website design (treatment) and notice an increase in conversions (metric), for the result to be considered \"attributable,\" you need to be sure that the increase is specifically due to the design change, and not, for example, due to an increase in traffic or a marketing campaign that occurred during the same period.\n",
    "3. **Sensitive**\n",
    "    - A metric is considered \"sensitive\" if it is responsive enough to detect significant effects from the applied modification.\n",
    "    - You want to identify a metric with low variability to increase the likelihood of detecting true effects.\n",
    "4. **Timely**\n",
    "    - A/B experiments need to be very quick, it's a very iterative process as a way to improve the product very quickly.\n",
    "    - Therefore, consider what short-term behavior can serve as a proxy for the long-term desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our success metric is **Conversion Rate**, which we aim to increase. However, it's crucial that this improvement does not come at the expense of the **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**, which should remain stable or improve.\n"

    "##### Estimating Conversion Rate\n",
    "1. The conversion rate for online grocery stores is the percentage of users who complete a purchase out of the total number of website visitors.\n",
    "2. Typical industry data:\n",
    "    - Based on ChatGPT’s response, on average, the conversion rate for online grocery stores can range from 2% to 5%. However, grocery stores have a certain specificity — if a customer visits with the intent to buy groceries, the conversion rate might be higher compared to apparel or electronics stores.\n",
    "    - For large retailers like Rimi, the conversion rate may be closer to the upper end of this range.\n",
    "3. Assumption:\n",
    "    - **Conversion rate** = 4% (which corresponds to the conversion rate for a typical online grocery store).\n",
    "    - **Standard Deviation** = 0.1%\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Estimating ARPU\n",
    "1. The average revenue per user (ARPU) in online grocery stores can vary significantly depending on how often customers place orders, their average basket size, and other factors.\n",
    "2. Typical industry data:\n",
    "    - ChatGPT suggests that ARPU for online grocery retailers often ranges from 20 to 100 euros, depending on the region and shopping frequency. The standard deviation, on average, can range from 20% to 50% of the average ARPU.\n",
    "3. Assumption:\n",
    "    - **Average ARPU** = 50 euros\n",
    "    - **Standard Deviation** = 15 euros (which corresponds to 30% of the average)."
